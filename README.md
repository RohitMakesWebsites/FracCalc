## Importing your Assignment into Eclipse
You can refer to the [intro-to-git page](https://github.com/WilcoxAPCS/intro-to-git/blob/master/README.md#importing-your-assignment-into-eclipse)
on how to import code from GitHub. **You should only need to do this once per computer.**

## Uploading Changes to GitHub

[intro-to-git page](https://github.com/WilcoxAPCS/intro-to-git/blob/master/README.md#uploading-your-changes-to-github)
on how to upload changes to GitHub.

## Testing Code

### Running Unit Tests
In Eclipse, right click on the appropriate test file (`FracCalcTestCheckpoint1.java`
for checkpoint 1, etc.). Choose Run As > JUnit Test. This will run set of tests
called unit tests to check that your code works. Any errors will be printed in red
in the console. **Your code must pass all unit tests for the checkpoint in order
receive full credit.** Note that these unit tests only cover a small set of possible
inputs and **you should not assume that your code works just because they pass.**
**It is your responsibility to determine if your code will work in all cases.**
